## Notes
Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
- I couldn't figure out how to share a variable between two views. I learned how to use segue, protocols, and delegates.
- Learning how to fix sigabrt errors and what caused them.
- Getting use to Swift syntax coming from Java and C style languages.
- Interacts between which percentage to use and when to enable/disable certain features.
